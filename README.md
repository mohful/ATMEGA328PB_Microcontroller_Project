# ATMEGA328PB_Microcontroller_Project
My system should be capable of running a hobby motor that acts as a fan when I press the button on the ATMEGA328PB. It should also be capable of lighting a series of LEDs connected to different ports of the microcontroller. 
The program written is supposed to run the hobby motor and light up the LEDs just by pressing the button. When the button is not pressed, nothing happens on the board. The program runs and enters the interrupt service routine where it performs a series of functions before checking if the button has been pressed again or not.
